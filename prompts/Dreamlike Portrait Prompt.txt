Dreamlike Portrait Prompt (Extended Atmospheric Version)

A luminous 8-k portrait that captures the fine balance between realism and dreamlike atmosphere.

Her eyes are pale green with soft gold centers, illuminated by the main light to reveal natural depth and genuine emotion. There is a trace of reflection from the softbox forming two rounded catchlights that add life and intimacy.

The slight narrowing of her eyelids gives the image narrative tension, as though she’s about to exhale or speak.
