Norwegian–Asian Portrait Prompt (Extended Version)

An 8-k photorealistic studio portrait, captured with a Hasselblad H6D-100c and a 100mm f/2.8 lens, showcasing the serene fusion of Nordic luminosity and refined East Asian features.

Her eyes are almond-shaped with clear ocean-gray irises flecked with subtle green, the interplay between Northern depth and Eastern precision. The inner corners carry a soft shadow gradient, while the whites of her eyes contain faint capillary reflections—small photographic imperfections that contribute to realism. The eyelashes curve delicately upward, each hair individually visible under macro resolution. Her eyebrows follow a clean, natural arch—neither overly groomed nor neglected—maintaining organic proportion.

Her hair is a medium ash-brown with a touch of soft gloss, fa
